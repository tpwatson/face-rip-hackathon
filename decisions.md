Big question, are we FOCUSING on NFT based content, or social media aggregated content?

NFT Focus:
-Users Are Pre-KYCd (keeps younger users locked out) - 9
-Users can sell their content NFTs (which was main idea) - 8
-Users can earn from the content from wallet users - 7
-Easier Market to enter as NFT space is hungrier for new experiences - 7
-Users have value with them already since wallets are required - 8
-Users may resist face recog and wallet log-in, even though they are not linked - (-5)
-Crypto community may see this as epic new experience - 7
-Easier case for on-boarding funny content creators as they don't have a social media directly for them - 8
-NFT's will have a new layer of objective value (viewers real reactions) - 9
-Social Media Content Creators can port their content over here as NFTs and get face data on their content. A new way to use their current content for fun and profit - 9
-Can market FaceRip as the one place to find NFTs that are funny af - which means launching into whitespace, in 0 competition - 10
-Expose TRUE scarecity, content that cannot be easily AI replicated or mass generated (yet). Content that is relevant and funny enough to make a real lol is much more scarce. - 10 
-Requiring Wallets to use site filters out spammers, bots, and some low level bad actors. - 8

Social Media Agg Focus:
-Easier to get good content up earlier (no learning curve just post already funny stuff) - 10
-Cheaper? To embed social media hosted content? - 7
-Wider audience to tap into (not just web3 initiated users), but not nec. easier - 6
-Users may resist face recog due to privacy sentiment - (-5)
-Users may see this as an epic new experience - 6
-User sharing goes viral much easier - 8
-Harder to KYC or age verify users - (-2)

Clearly I need to focus in on making this an NFT hub - with a unique twist. 
Not just a new social media platform that happens to support NFTs.


Second:
Is all content minted before its viewable?

Yes, only NFTs
Before posting anything users have to go through the minting flow. - 5


No, NFT version optional.
Users can upload content, if they want to make it an NFT then it becomes sellable.
have regular content up, and not mint it unless it seem worth it. - 10
