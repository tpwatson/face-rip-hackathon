Include a way to seperate user's viewer face from their creator account.
THis is for like bearable bull or other creators who remain anonymouse.

Their face can be show via a seperate wallet from their creator profile.
This is optional and up to the creator if they want to show their support of other creators or not.

Unlink laughs from account, in case people don't want to show the things they laugh at evily lol

If a person still doesn't want to show their face, put an option for face recog landmarks lines and dots only.
Some people may really wish not to show their face for personal reasons.

But should there be a penalty for not showing faces? Does this hurt the creator's incentives?
