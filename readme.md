Value Proposition:
Content creators can see real reactions to their content (funny content gives them lots of real laughing and smiling faces). Their content can be minted into NFTs (that have a history of face reactions). The NFTs can then be sold at a high price do to their intrinsic value.
Content consumers have a new way to view content, stuff that doesn't cause a reaction gets filtered out, and content that is so good it creates reactions will rise.
They also can engage in a more social and real form of social media because their face is in it.
Using faces, wallets, and real world value we can eliminate many bots, spammers, scammers.
