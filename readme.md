Start with skeleton, just pages and links no content or design yet

Index page
Feed Page
Profile Page
Authentication

Next build the nav bar v1
Logo (placeholder) on left, a search bar (non func), upload button, login button (highlighted), settings icon (non func)

Now determine how to best display content units.

If users can share youtube, twitter, tiktok, or upload - what is the best way?

Cards for each type.

When a user watches the content we need to engage the camera, and recognize face then start playing.



1✔️) Add way to upload a piece of content (ipfs) using web3.storage for simplicity

2) save data to DB (somewhere)
Need to work out what kind of DBs will be implemented


3) mint NFTObject to XRPL
Get a feel for the costs and frictions for user to mint NFTs onto XRPL

view on content single page
engage camera while viewing content


Main purpose needed:
Creator upload/mint funny content
Viewer View content
If laugh
    save face or landmark data somewhere linked to creator's profile data
Poster's profile shows collected faces


Big question, are we FOCUSING on NFT based content, or social media aggregated content?
NFT

-Users Are Pre-KYCd (keeps younger users locked out) - 9
-Users can sell their content NFTs (which was main idea) - 8
-Users can earn from the content from wallet users - 7
-Easier Market to enter as NFT space is hungrier for new experiences - 7
-Users have value with them already since wallets are required - 8
-Users may resist face recog and wallet log-in, even though they are not linked - (-5)
-Crypto community may see this as epic new experience - 7
-Easier case for on-boarding funny content creators as they don't have a social media directly for them - 8
-NFT's will have a new layer of objective value (viewers real reactions) - 9
-Social Media Content Creators can port their content over here as NFTs and get face data on their content. A new way to use their current content for fun and profit - 9
-Can market FaceRip as the one place to find NFTs that are funny af - which means launching into whitespace, in 0 competition - 10
-Expose TRUE scarecity, content that cannot be easily AI replicated or mass generated (yet). Content that is relevant and funny enough to make a real lol is much more scarce. - 10 

Social Media Agg
-Easier to get good content up earlier (no learning curve just post already funny stuff) - 10
-Cheaper? To embed social media hosted content? - 7
-Wider audience to tap into (not just web3 initiated users), but not nec. easier - 6
-Users may resist face recog due to privacy sentiment - (-5)
-Users may see this as an epic new experience - 6
-User sharing goes viral much easier - 8
-Harder to KYC or age verify users - (-2)

Clearly I need to focus in on making this an NFT hub - with a unique twist.
